        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 kg strong bread flour</li>
            <li>625 ml tepid water</li>
            <li>3 x 7 g sachets dried yeast</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 level tablespoon fine sea salt</li>
            <li>Extra flour for dusting</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>On a clean surface, pile the flour and create a large well in the center. Pour half of the tepid water into the well, then add the yeast, sugar, and salt. Stir gently with a fork to combine.</li>
            <li>Gradually bring in the flour from the edges of the well until you achieve a thick, porridge-like consistency. Add the remaining water and continue mixing until the dough starts to come together.</li>
            <li>Flour your hands and knead the dough for about 4-5 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. This step is crucial for developing gluten, which gives bread its structure.</li>
            <li>Place the kneaded dough in a lightly floured bowl, cover it with cling film or a damp cloth, and let it prove in a warm place for about 30 minutes or until it doubles in size.</li>
            <li>Once risen, knock back the dough by punching it down gently to release air. Shape it into a loaf or rolls and place them on a baking tray. Allow them to prove again for another 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 220°C (428°F). Bake the bread for about 25-30 minutes or until golden brown and hollow-sounding when tapped on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Let the bread cool on a wire rack before slicing. Enjoy your homemade bread fresh or toasted!</li>
        </ol>
